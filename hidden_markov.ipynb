    "\n",
    "**Observations:** Each state has a particular outcome or observation associated with it based on a probability distribution. An example of this is the following: *On a hot day Tim has a 80% chance of being happy and a 20% chance of being sad.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transitions:** Each state will have a probability defining the likelyhood of transitioning to a different state. An example is the following: *a cold day has a 30% chance of being followed by a hot day and a 70% chance of being follwed by another cold day.*\n",
